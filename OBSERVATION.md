## ðŸ§  Reflection

While testing various combinations of parameters on the same user prompt (e.g., "Generate a product description for the Tesla Model S"), I observed significant changes in the structure, creativity, and verbosity of the outputs. With a **temperature of 0.0**, the model produced highly factual, repetitive, and deterministic outputsâ€”often phrased in a plain, structured tone. As the **temperature increased to 0.7 and 1.2**, the outputs became more expressive, imaginative, and sometimes slightly exaggerated. A higher temperature clearly encouraged more diverse and creative word choices but introduced a risk of incoherence or factual inaccuracies.

Varying **presence and frequency penalties** also had notable effects. A **higher presence penalty (1.5)** encouraged the model to introduce new concepts and reduce reuse of key terms, which was useful for variety but sometimes led to deviation from the main topic. A **higher frequency penalty (1.5)** reduced repetition of specific phrases or words and encouraged lexical diversity. In combination with high temperature, it often produced more interesting descriptions, but also more unexpected shifts in tone or focus. Overall, these parameters allow fine-tuning of output styleâ€”from dry and consistent to rich and expressiveâ€”based on the needs of a specific application.
